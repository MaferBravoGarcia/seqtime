\title{Analyse an interaction matrix}
\usage{
getAStats(A, statsType = "interactions", plot.degree = FALSE,
  collapse.degree = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{the interaction matrix}

\item{statsType}{interactions, degree or network}

\item{plot.degree}{plot the degree distribution (for statsType network)}

\item{collapse.degree}{sum degrees for taxa with the same name (for statsType degree)}
}
\value{
for degree a matrix with positive, negative and total degree (including self-loops, excluding missing values), else a list; for statsType interactions: meanstrength = average interaction strength, varstrength = variance of interaction strength, nbinteractions = total interaction number (excluding diagonal), nbmut = number of mutualisms, nbcomp = number of competitions, nbcom = number of commensalisms, nbam = number of amensalisms, nbexp = number of exploitations, for statsType network: nodenum (node number), arcnum (arc number, including diagonal), mod (fast greedy modularity), cc (average clustering coefficient), avgpathlength (average shortest path length)
}
\description{
Count interaction types or compute network properties of interaction matrix.
The mean interaction strength is computed according to Coyte et al.
by fitting a half-normal distribution to the realized interaction strengths.
Graph properties (modularity, average clustering coefficient, average path length)
are computed using igraph functions.
