\title{Plot relationship between row mean and row variance}
\usage{
taylor(x, type = "taylor", pseudo = 0, col = "black", header = "",
  plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix}

\item{type}{the type of plot to do: mean.var (mean vs variance), boxplot (row-wise), taylor (powerlaw fitted to mean vs variance)}

\item{pseudo}{add a pseudo count to deal with zeros in log-log plot (for type=taylor)}

\item{col}{the color of the dots}

\item{header}{header string}

\item{plot}{whether to do the plot}
}
\value{
for type taylor, the slope, p-value and adjusted R2 of the Taylor law are returned (slope, pval, adjR2)
}
\description{
The power law of mean and variance is also known as Taylor's law.
Taylor's law: var(Y) = a*mean(Y)^b, in log-scale: log(var(Y)) = log(a)+b*log(mean(Y))
