\description{
Test the stability of an interaction matrix using Coyte's criterium
or the eigenvalue criterium.
Coyte's criterium is: max(r_e,r_s) - s < 0,
where s is the average of the diagonal values (the intra-species competition),
r_e is the half-horizontal radius of the eigenvalue ellipse of A and
r_s is the eigenvalue corresponding to the average row sum.
The more negative max(r_e,r_s) - s is, the quicker the community returns
to equilibrium.
This criterium assumes that realized inter-species interaction strengths are drawn
from a half normal distribution |N(0,sigma2)| (the absolute of the normal
distribution). Only non-zero, non-diagonal interactions are considered to
compute the mean interaction strength.
The eigenvalue criterium tests whether all real parts of the eigenvalues
of the interaction matrix are smaller than zero.
Ricker simply runs a simulation with Ricker and tests whether an explosion occurs.
